# =====================================================================
# 1) Loop over a string -> one character at a time
# =====================================================================
for ch in "AI":
    print("Letter:", ch)
print()

# =====================================================================
# 2) Loop over a list -> one element at a time (the everyday case)
# =====================================================================

# =====================================================================
# 3) REAL USE: total up a column of numbers (an "accumulator")
# =====================================================================

# 4) enumerate -> get the POSITION and the VALUE together
# =====================================================================
# Perfect for numbered menus, leaderboards, "line 5 of the file", etc.

# for name in leaderboard:
#     print(i, name)
#     i += 1          # easy to forget / put in the wrong place

# =====================================================================
# 5) REAL USE: validate / filter as you go
# =====================================================================
# Loop over signup emails and flag the ones that look invalid.

# =====================================================================
# 6) REAL USE: build a NEW list from an old one (transform each item)
# =====================================================================
# Apply a 10% discount to every price. This "build a new list" shape is
# everywhere in data work (and is what a list comprehension shortens later).
