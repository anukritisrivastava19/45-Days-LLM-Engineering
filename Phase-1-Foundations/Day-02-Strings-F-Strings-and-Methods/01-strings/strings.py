# ----- Making strings: single or double quotes both work -----

name = "Riya"
print(greeting)

print("type of a string ->", type(greeting))   # <class 'str'>

# ----- Quotes inside quotes: pick the OTHER quote on the outside -----
print("it's a sunny day")          # ' inside, so wrap in "

# ----- Concatenation: join strings with + -----

print("=" * 20)                    # a nice divider line: ====================

# ----- Gotcha: you can't add a string and a number directly -----
